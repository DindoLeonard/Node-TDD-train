# JWT PRACTICES

- advantages & disadvantages
- can set an expire time

```ts
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
import User from '../user/User';

const createToken = (user: User) => {
  // can set to '1d' for 1 day or months
  return jwt.sign({ id: user.id }, 'this-is-our-secret', { expiresIn: 60 });
};
```

- Good for microservice architecture because every service just shares the secret-key and and if token is valid, then it is valid everywhere to use the server and access its database

- Bad if the secret-key is compromised then anyone can generate a valid token for the app

- If user is removed, token will still be valid until it expires. Can be disadvantage
